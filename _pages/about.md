Zhichao Li is an Associate Researcher at the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences. 

Before joinning CAS, he was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Earth System Science at Tsinghua University. Li‚Äôs research interests include the cloud-based analysis of geospatial big data, machine learning and deep learning in the areas of monitoring the spatio-temporal risks of infectious diseases. He received a B.S. degree in geology from Northwest University, a M.S. degree in geographic information science from University of Bordeaux, France and a Ph.D. degree from University of Montpellier, France. 

He has published more than 30 journal articles, including Current Climate Change Reports, Journal of Cleaner Production, International journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, Remote Sensing, BMC public health, etc.
